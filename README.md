# Poetry Template

[![Test and build](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/poetry_template_2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/poetry_template_2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a minimal Python 3.9 application that uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for packaging and dependency management. It also provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks (for [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)) and automated tests using [pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with a dedicated GitHub Action. It was developed by the [Imperial College Research Computing Service](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/).
